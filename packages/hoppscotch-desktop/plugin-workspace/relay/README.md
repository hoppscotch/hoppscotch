## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
relay = { git = "https://github.com/CuriousCorrelation/relay.git" }
```

## Features

- ðŸ¦€ Blazingly fast!
- HTTP client built on libcurl
- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 support
- Security with SSL/TLS certificate management
- Proxy support with authentication
- Multiple authentication methods (Basic, Bearer, Digest)
- Content handling (JSON, Form Data, Binary)
- Custom security configurations
- Async request execution with cancellation support

## Usage

```rust
use relay::{Request, Response, execute};

let request = Request {
    id: 1,
    url: "https://api.example.com".to_string(),
    method: Method::Get,
    version: Version::Http2,
    // ... configure other options
};

let response = execute(request).await?;
```

> [!NOTE]
> All requests are executed asynchronously and can be cancelled using the `cancel(request_id)` function.

## Security Features

> [!TIP]
> You can configure certificate validation, host verification, and custom certificates:

```rust
let security_config = SecurityConfig {
    validate_certificates: Some(true),
    verify_host: Some(true),
    certificates: Some(CertificateConfig {
        client: Some(CertificateType::Pem { 
            cert: cert_data,
            key: key_data 
        }),
        ca: Some(vec![ca_cert_data])
    })
};
```

## Error Handling

The crate uses a custom error type `RelayError` that provides information about failures:

```rust
#[derive(Error)]
pub enum RelayError {
    Network { message: String, cause: Option<String> },
    Certificate { message: String, cause: Option<String> },
    Parse { message: String, cause: Option<String> },
    // ... other variants
}
```

## Requirements

- Rust 1.77.2 or later
- OpenSSL development libraries
- libcurl with SSL and HTTP/2 support

> [!WARNING]
> This crate uses custom forks of some dependencies for NTLM support and consistent OpenSSL backend across platforms.
