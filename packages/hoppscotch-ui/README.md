# Hoppscotch UI <font size=2><sup>ALPHA</sup></font>

</div>

Welcome to hoppscotch-ui, a collection of presentational components for our web applications. This library is part of the hoppscotch monorepo and contains components such as buttons, spinners, modals, tabs, windows, etc.

## Usage

To use the components in project, simply name the component with `directory` name as alias:

For example `Primary Button` component is in `button` directory and the file name is `Primary.vue`. So, use that you have to write `<ButtonPrimary />`

## Histoire

We've included Histoire in this library which is similar to Storybook, to make it easy to play with the components in the browser. You can run Histoire in the browser with command

`pnpm run story:dev`

You can also use [Histoire](https://histoire.dev/) to create stories for your components and test them in different scenarios.
