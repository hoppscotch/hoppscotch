/**
 * This service provides debug utilities for the application and is
 * supposed to be used only in development.
 *
 * This service logs events from the container and also events
 * from all the services that are bound to the container. Along with that
 * this service exposes all registered services (including this) to global
 * scope (window) under the ID of the service so it can be accessed using
 * the console for debugging.
 *
 * This service injects couple of utilities into the global scope:
 *  - `_getService(id: string): Service | undefined` - Returns the service instance with the given ID or undefined.
 *  - `_getBoundServiceIDs(): string[]` - Returns the IDs of all the bound services.
