# Fix: Implement workspace-scoped tab persistence for macOS client

## 🐛 Problem Description

When switching workspaces in the Hoppscotch macOS client, opened tabs did not switch along with the workspace context. Instead, tabs remained visible in the window regardless of which workspace was active. This created confusion as users expected tabs to be hidden when switching away from a workspace and reappear when returning to that specific workspace.

### Current Behavior
- ❌ Tabs persist globally across all workspaces
- ❌ Switching from Personal to Team workspace shows the same tabs
- ❌ No isolation between different team workspaces
- ❌ Poor user experience with mixed context

### Expected Behavior  
- ✅ Each workspace should have its own set of tabs
- ✅ Tabs should be hidden when switching away from a workspace
- ✅ Tabs should reappear when returning to the same workspace
- ✅ Complete isolation between Personal and Team workspaces
- ✅ Complete isolation between different Team workspaces

## 🔧 Solution Implementation

This PR introduces **workspace-scoped tab persistence** that maintains separate tab states for each workspace context.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **New Workspace-Aware Tab Utility** (`workspace-aware-tab.ts`)
- Created utility function `getWorkspaceScopedTabKey()` to generate workspace-specific storage keys
- Personal workspace: `REST_TABS_PERSONAL`, `GQL_TABS_PERSONAL` 
- Team workspaces: `REST_TABS_TEAM_{teamID}`, `GQL_TABS_TEAM_{teamID}`

#### 2. **Enhanced REST Tab Service** (`rest.ts`)
- Added workspace change watching using Vue's `watch()` API
- Implemented `saveTabsForWorkspace()` to persist current tabs when switching away
- Implemented `loadTabsForWorkspace()` to restore tabs when switching to a workspace
- Added migration support for existing global tab state to personal workspace
- Added fallback to create fresh tabs for new team workspaces

#### 3. **Enhanced GraphQL Tab Service** (`graphql.ts`)
- Mirror implementation of workspace awareness for GraphQL tabs
- Consistent behavior with REST tabs across both tab types
- Same migration and fallback strategies

#### 4. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing tab state is automatically migrated to Personal workspace scope
- No data loss for current users
- Graceful handling of missing workspace-specific data

### Technical Details

#### Workspace Key Generation
```typescript
export function getWorkspaceScopedTabKey(
  baseKey: string,
  workspace: Workspace
): string {
  if (workspace.type === "personal") {
    return `${baseKey}_PERSONAL`
  }
  return `${baseKey}_TEAM_${workspace.teamID}`
}
```

#### Workspace Change Detection
```typescript
watch(
  () => this.workspaceService!.currentWorkspace.value,
  async (newWorkspace: Workspace, oldWorkspace?: Workspace) => {
    // Save current tabs for old workspace
    if (oldWorkspace && this.currentWorkspaceKey) {
      await this.saveTabsForWorkspace(oldWorkspace)
    }
    // Load tabs for new workspace
    await this.loadTabsForWorkspace(newWorkspace)
  },
  { immediate: true }
)
```

#### Migration Strategy
1. When loading Personal workspace for the first time, check for legacy global tab state
2. If found, migrate it to the new Personal workspace scope
3. Save migrated state using new workspace-scoped key
4. For Team workspaces, start with fresh default tabs if no saved state exists

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Personal ↔ Team Workspace Switching**
   - Open tabs in Personal workspace
   - Switch to Team workspace → should show fresh tabs
   - Switch back to Personal → should restore original tabs

2. **Multiple Team Workspace Isolation**
   - Open different tabs in Team A
   - Switch to Team B → should show fresh tabs  
   - Switch back to Team A → should restore Team A tabs
   - Switch to Team B again → should restore Team B tabs

3. **Migration Testing**
   - Test with existing users who have global tab state
   - Verify tabs are preserved in Personal workspace
   - Verify no data loss during migration

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test with corrupted workspace tab data
   - Verify graceful fallback to default tabs
   - Test rapid workspace switching

### Platform-Specific Testing
- ✅ **macOS Desktop Client** (primary target)
- ✅ **Windows Desktop Client** (should work consistently) 
- ✅ **Web Client** (should work consistently)

## 📋 Files Changed

```
packages/hoppscotch-common/src/services/tab/
├── workspace-aware-tab.ts          # NEW: Workspace utility functions
├── rest.ts                        # MODIFIED: Added workspace awareness
└── graphql.ts                     # MODIFIED: Added workspace awareness
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- **No action required** - migration happens automatically
- Personal workspace will inherit existing global tabs
- Team workspaces will start fresh (expected behavior)

### For Developers
- Tab persistence is now workspace-scoped by default
- Use `getWorkspaceScopedTabKey()` for any new tab-related persistence
- Workspace changes trigger automatic save/restore cycles

## 🚀 Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- ✅ **Reduced memory usage** - only loads tabs for active workspace
- ✅ **Faster workspace switching** - pre-existing tabs load instantly
- ✅ **Better user experience** - clear context separation

### Considerations
- Minimal storage overhead (additional keys per workspace)
- Negligible performance impact during workspace switches
- Memory usage scales with number of active workspaces (acceptable)

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before This Fix
```
Personal Workspace: [Tab A, Tab B, Tab C]
    ↓ Switch to Team 1
Team 1 Workspace: [Tab A, Tab B, Tab C] ❌ Wrong context!
    ↓ Switch to Team 2  
Team 2 Workspace: [Tab A, Tab B, Tab C] ❌ Still wrong context!
```

### After This Fix
```
Personal Workspace: [Tab A, Tab B, Tab C]
    ↓ Switch to Team 1
Team 1 Workspace: [Fresh Team 1 Tabs] ✅ Correct context!
    ↓ Switch to Team 2
Team 2 Workspace: [Fresh Team 2 Tabs] ✅ Correct context!
    ↓ Switch back to Personal
Personal Workspace: [Tab A, Tab B, Tab C] ✅ Restored correctly!
```
