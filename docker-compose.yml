# To make it easier to self-host, we have a preset docker compose config that also
# has a container with a Postgres instance running.
# You can tweak around this file to match your instances

# PROFILES EXPLANATION:
#
# We use Docker Compose profiles to manage different deployment scenarios and avoid port conflicts.
#
# These are all the available profiles:
# - default: All-in-one service + database + auto-migration (recommended for most users)
# - default-no-db: All-in-one service without database (for users with external DB)
# - backend: The backend service only
# - app: The main Hoppscotch application and the webapp server
# - admin: The self-host admin dashboard only
# - database: Just the PostgreSQL database
# - just-backend: All services except webapp for local development
# - deprecated: All deprecated services (not recommended)

# USAGE:
#
# To run the default setup: docker compose --profile default up
# To run without database: docker compose --profile default-no-db up
# To run specific components: docker compose --profile backend up
# To run all except webapp: docker compose --profile just-backend up
# To run deprecated services: docker compose --profile deprecated up

# NOTE: The default and default-no-db profiles should not be mixed with individual service
# profiles as they would conflict on ports.

services:
  # This service runs the backend app in the port 3170

# DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS:
# 1. Default deployment (recommended):
#    docker compose --profile default up
#    This will start: AIO + database + auto-migration
#
# 2. Default deployment without database:
#    docker compose --profile default-no-db up
#    This will start: AIO only (use when you have an external database)
#
# 3. Individual service deployment:
#    docker compose --profile backend up  # Just the backend
#    docker compose --profile app up      # Just the app and webapp server
#    docker compose --profile admin up    # Just the admin dashboard
#    docker compose --profile database up # Just the database
#
# 4. Development deployment:
#    docker compose --profile just-backend up  # All services except webapp
#
# 5. Deprecated services:
#    docker compose --profile deprecated up
#    This will start all deprecated services (not recommended for new deployments)
#
# Remember: The default and default-no-db profiles should not be mixed with individual service
# profiles as they would conflict on ports.
