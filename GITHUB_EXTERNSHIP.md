# **GitHub Externship @ Hoppscotch**

**We ❤️ open source**

We are super excited to be a ‘Partner Organization’ of GitHub Externship 2021 and look forward to supporting all interested students to participate and contribute to our [open source projects](https://github.com/hoppscotch).

This document covers the process, expectations and guidelines for any interested student so that we can guide, mentor in the best possible manner and most importantly review your community engagement which is a critical factor along with your project idea to be selected from our organization.

**This post will be updated from time to time. So please keep an eye on it.**

Before, any of you jump in and start contributing, here are a few documents from the GitHub Externship Team which we advise every student to read through carefully and thoroughly:

- [GitHub Externship: Website](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/index.html)
- [GitHub Externship: Program Structure](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/structure.html)

Our awesome community members frequently request for features on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GAMWxmR), [Telegram group](https://t.me/hoppscotch_externship), [GitHub issues tab](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and we have a never ending list of awesome ideas. However, keeping in mind the 3 months time span, we have filtered through our stockpile and come up with the following ideas for [GitHub Externship](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/index.html) program.

## **Ideas**

If you’re a student interested in working with Hoppscotch during GitHub Externship, we’ve assembled for you a list of 20 ideas under the following three categories:

### **1. Implement existing feature requests:**

- [gRPC-Web support](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues/402)

  Like swagger, let users view message formats from `.proto` / `URL` and test the server methods by sending any messages from the Hoppscotch.

- [Swagger / OpenAPI support](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues/470)

  Like [Swagger Inspector](https://inspector.swagger.io/builder) / [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io). Let users import `swagger.json` and test the server methods by sending any messages from the Hoppscotch.

- [Mock Server](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues/1598)

  Mock server allows users to create mock endpoints that accepts request from the system-under-test or from a `json` file.

### **2. Implement new features:**

If you'd like to implement a totally new feature to help developers make API testing easy, feel free to come up with your own feature request or a port of feature from other API testing tools.

### **3. Refactor existing features:**

If you'd like to refactor an already implemented feature / workflow - feel free to open a PR to do that. We appreciate using industry best pratices and latest technologies on all of our open source projects.
