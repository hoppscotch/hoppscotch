# Hoppscotch JavaScript Sandbox <font size=2><sup>ALPHA</sup></font>

</div>

This package deals with providing a JavaScript sandbox for executing various security sensitive external scripts.

## How does this work?

This package makes use of [quickjs-emscripten](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quickjs-emscripten) for building sandboxes for running external code on Hoppscotch.

Currently implemented sandboxes:
- Hoppscotch Test Scripts
- Hoppscotch Pre Request Scripts
